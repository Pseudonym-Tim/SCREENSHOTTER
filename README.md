# SCREENSHOTTER
A simple tool to quickly and easily take cropped screenshots, written in C# using WinForms and the .NET framework...
Designed to be as lightweight and minimalistic as possible, so it's pretty fast and to the point!

* .NET framework 6.0 is required to run this application!

# USAGE:
* Upon launching the program you'll notice that the screen becomes darker and that you can now click and drag to select a specific region.
The region that you have selected will be saved as an image to `"C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Pictures\screenshots\"`. The image will automatically be copied
to your clipboard, so you can paste it directly into a Discord chat for example.

* Holding the CTRL key will cause the image to open in your specified image viewer, if you want to quickly use it as a reference!
* It's highly recommended to launch the program using a keybind macro!
